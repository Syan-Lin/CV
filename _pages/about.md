I am currently in my second year as a Master's student in Computer Science and Technology, with research interests in **machine learning**, **data mining**, and **distributed systems**. I have developed an LLM-based system that has gained close to **1,000 stars** on GitHub.

I possess a strong passion for programming and have built a solid foundation in various programming languages. I possess a **research-oriented mindset**, a **curiosity** about underlying principles, and a **self-driven nature**. Additionally, I have maintained a habit of writing blogs for many years.

If you are interested, please feel free to send me an email(lin.siyuan@foxmail.com).
