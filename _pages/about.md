I am currently in **THU** as a PhD candidate in Earth System Science, with research interests in **high-performance computing (HPC)**.

I possess a strong passion for programming and have built a solid foundation in various programming languages. I have developed an LLM-based chat system that has gained close to **1,000 stars** on GitHub. Additionally, I have maintained a habit of writing blogs for many years.

Education
------
- Ph.D. student in Earth System Science, 2025-Present, **Tsinghua University**
- M.S in Computer Science and Technology, 2022-2025, **Ocean University of China**
- B.S in Computer Science and Technology, 2018-2022, **Ocean University of China**

Project Experience
------

**Custom Alerting Platform**, Software Engineer Intern, Meituan, 2024/05-2024/10

Built a configurable alerting system that delivers rich, interactive notification cards directly in the company’s office app—replacing redirects to the legacy alert platform. Led end-to-end development including rule engine design, card templating, and integration with existing SQL-based analysis workflows.

**[CyberWaifu: LLM-based chat system](https://github.com/Syan-Lin/CyberWaifu), 1,000+ stars**, 2023/04-2023/06

Develop a RAG system before the concept of RAG turned out, and integrated Vits, search and chat agents(it's not called agents at that time).

**[Baize: Terminal-Integrated LLM Assistant](https://github.com/Syan-Lin/baize)**, 2024/06-2024/08

Built a lightweight CLI tool for using LLMs directly in the terminal—enabling command lookup, file-based QA, and log analysis via simple, scriptable commands. Focused on minimalism and usability, avoiding complex agent workflows to keep the experience native to terminal environments.

Research Experience
------

**Animal Behavior Annotation Platform**, Research Intern, HKUST(GZ), 2024/03-2024/05

Built an interactive GUI for semi-automated labeling of animal behavior from acceleration time-series data. Integrated a 1D CNN model to predict behaviors (e.g., flying, foraging) and enabled biologists to review and correct labels efficiently.

**Long-term Vessel Trajectory Prediction**, Ocean University of China, 2023/07-2024/10

Proposed a novel spatiotemporal prediction architecture that integrates VMS data with hydrological factors (e.g., SST, currents) for high-accuracy fishing vessel trajectory prediction. By incorporating environmental attention and hierarchical Transformer blocks, HDFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance in predicting long-term vessel trajectories.
